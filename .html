<h1>Rose Martynenko</h1>
 
  <p class= "Myinfo">I am a student in EWU; majoring in VCD with minor CSCD <em>(web application design)</em>. One of the favorite books on English was from school and it was <strong>The Thief Lord</strong>. Many books are interesting, but during my childhood I did not have any favorite books, and this was my first and maybe last, that I wanted to read, from beginning to the end. However, there is <span>top favorite movies</span> which are mostly on the other language than English. </p>
